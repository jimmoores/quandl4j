      "description": "The Bologna declaration was signed in 1999 by 29 European ministers responsible for higher education. Today, 46 signatory countries are engaged in the process towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental initiative which also involves the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO-CEPES, as well as representatives of higher education institutions, students, staff, employers and quality assurance agencies. It aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010, and to promote the European system of higher education worldwide. More information on the Bologna process is available on http://ec.europa.eu/education/higher-education/doc1290_en.htm.\r\nIn the framework of the indicators for the monitoring of the social dimension and mobility of the Bologna Process, the EU-SILC (EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) data of interest cover individual's educational attainment, income and, from the intergenerational transmission of poverty ad hoc module, educational attainment of the parents. The following data-sets, having EU-SILC as source, on the Bologna Process are available:\r\nA. Widening access\r\neduc_bo_ac_sobs: Individuals having completed tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), according to the educational background of their parents, by sex\r\neduc_bo_ac_soba: Individuals having completed tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), according to the educational background of their parents, by age \r\nD. Effective outcomes and employability\r\neduc_bo_ou_attd: Annual gross income of workers by educational attainment (2006)\r\neduc_bo_ou_terd: Annual gross income of workers with tertiary education (ISCED 5-6) , by sex (2006)\r\nThe general aim of the EU-SILC domain is to provide comparable statistics and indicators on key aspects of the citizens' living conditions across Europe.\r\nThis domain actually contains a range of social statistics and indicators relating to the risks of income poverty and social exclusion. There are both conceptual and methodological problems in defining and measuring income poverty and social exclusion. Since a 1984 decision of the European Council, the following are regarded as poor: \"those persons, families and groups of persons whose resources (material, cultural and social) are so limited as to exclude them from the minimum acceptable way of life in the Member State to which they belong\". On this basis, measures of poverty at EU level adopt an approach which is both multi-dimensional and relative. In June 2006, a new set of common indicators for the social protection and social inclusion process was adopted. (For more details and definitions of these indicators: Indicators 2006).\r\nTo investigate particular areas of policy interest in more detail, target secondary areas, to be collected every four years or less frequently, are added to the cross-sectional component of EU-SILC. \"The intergenerational transmission of poverty\" was chosen as the area to be implemented for 2005. This specific module, collected in 2005, had as purpose to collect and compile relevant and robust information on background factors linked to adult social exclusion, minimising the burden of respondents to provide accurate detailed indicators sufficiently comparable across the EU capturing the effects of childhood experiences on poverty risk.\r\nMore general information on EU-SILC is available on\r\nilc_base.htm\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/educ_bo_ac_sobs_esms.htm",
