This conceptual framework follows the i2010 Benchmarking Framework which itself followed-up the eEurope 2005 Action Plan.\r\nSome data for the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and Korea have been supplied via the OECD (or coming from other sources which are given) in ratio format with no validation by Eurostat.\r\nThe aim of the European ICT surveys is to collect and disseminate harmonised and comparable information on the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals and in enterprises at European level. Data for this collection are supplied directly from the surveys with no separate treatment.\r\nICT USAGE IN ENTERPRISES\r\nThe aim of this survey is the timely provision of statistics on enterprises and the information society. This module provides a framework for the requirements in terms of coverage, duration and periodicity, subjects covered, breakdowns of data provision and any necessary pilot studies.This survey covers enterprises having their main economic activity in NACE sections as specified under section 3.3 \"Sector Coverage\" below.\r\nCoverage:\r\nThe characteristics to be provided for the benchmarking are drawn from the following list of subjects:- development of broadband,- security (special module in 2010),- skills (special module in 2007),- e-business (special module in 2008),- e-commerce (special module in 2009),- adoption of ICT by businesses,- impact of adoption of ICT by businesses,- public services (special module in 2011).\r\nBreakdowns:\r\n- by size class,- by NACE categories,- by region (until 2010)\r\nICT USAGE IN HOUSEHOLDS AND BY INDIVIDUALS\r\nThe aim of this survey is the timely provision of statistics on individuals, households and the information society.

      "description": "The harmonised data on accidents at work are collected in the framework of the European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW), on the basis of a methodology developed in 1990.\r\nThe data refer to accidents at work resulting in more than 3 days' absence from work (serious accidents) and fatal accidents. A fatal accident is defined as an accident which leads to the death of a victim within one year of the accident.\r\nThe indicators used are the number and incidence rate of serious and fatal accidents at work.\r\nThe incidence rate of serious accidents at work is the number of persons involved in accidents at work with more than 3 days' absence per 100,000 persons in employment.\r\nThe incidence rate of fatal accidents at work is the number of persons with fatal accidents at work per 100,000 persons in employment.\r\nThe national ESAW sources are the declarations of accidents at work, either to the public (Social Security) or private specific insurance for accidents at work, or to other relevant national authority (Labour Inspection, etc.) for countries having a \"universal\" Social Security system. For the Netherlands only survey data are available for the non-fatal accidents at work (a special module in the national labour force survey).\r\nSector coverage:\r\nIn general the private sector is covered by all national reporting systems. However some important sectors are not covered by all Member States. The specification of sectors is given according to the NACE classification (NACE = Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne).\r\nThe incidence rate is calculated for the total of the so-called 9 common branches (See point 3.6).\r\nFor a structured metadata overview on variables, coverage of sectors and professional status please see also the annex Metadata_overview_2007.\r\nStatistical adjustments:\r\nBecause the frequency of work accidents is higher in some branches (high-risk sectors), an adjustment is performed to get more standardised incidence rates. For more details, please see the summary methodology (link at the bottom of the page).\r\nGeographical coverage:\r\nFor accidents at work, data are available for all old EU-Member States (EU 15) and Norway. The methodology has also been implemented in the New Member States and Switzerland with first data being available for the reference year 2004.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/hsw_acc7_work_esms.htm",

A fatal accident is defined as an accident which leads to the death of a victim within one year of the accident.\r\nThe indicators used are the number and incidence rate of serious and fatal accidents at work.\r\nThe incidence rate of serious accidents at work is the number of persons involved in accidents at work with more than 3 days' absence per 100,000 persons in employment.\r\nThe incidence rate of fatal accidents at work is the number of persons with fatal accidents at work per 100,000 persons in employment.\r\nThe national ESAW sources are the declarations of accidents at work, either to the public (Social Security) or private specific insurance for accidents at work, or to other relevant national authority (Labour Inspection, etc.) for countries having a \"universal\" Social Security system. For the Netherlands only survey data are available for the non-fatal accidents at work (a special module in the national labour force survey).\r\nSector coverage:\r\nIn general the private sector is covered by all national reporting systems. However some important sectors are not covered by all Member States. The specification of sectors is given according to the NACE classification (NACE = Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne).\r\nThe incidence rate is calculated for the total of the so-called 9 common branches (See point 3.6).\r\nFor a structured metadata overview on variables, coverage of sectors and professional status please see also the annex Metadata_overview_2007.\r\nStatistical adjustments:\r\nBecause the frequency of work accidents is higher in some branches (high-risk sectors), an adjustment is performed to get more standardised incidence rates. For more details, please see the summary methodology (link at the bottom of the page).\r\nGeographical coverage:\r\nFor accidents at work, data are available for all old EU-Member States (EU 15) and Norway. The methodology has also been implemented in the New Member States and Switzerland with first data being available for the reference year 2004.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/hsw_acc7_work_esms.htm",
