      "description": "On the basis of the Regulation on waste statistics (EC) No. 2150/2002, amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No. 849/2010, data on the generation and treatment of waste is collected from the Member States. The information on waste generation has a breakdown in sources (several business activities according to the NACE classification and household activities) and in waste categories (according to the European Waste Classification for statistical purposes). The information on waste treatment is broken down to five treatment types (recovery, incineration with energy recovery, other incineration, disposal on land and land treatment) and in waste categories; this data set also has a breakdown in regions (NUTS1). All values are measured in tonnes of waste.\r\nThe Member States are free to decide on the data collection methods. The general options are: surveys, administrative sources, statistical estimations or some combination of methods.\r\nFor the first reference year 2004 Member States could apply for permission not to deliver part of the information: waste generated by agriculture and fishing and waste generated in the services sector. For this reason this information is missing for some of the countries.\r\nPreviously data on waste was collected on a voluntary basis with the joint OECD/Eurostat questionnaire on waste. A separate annual collection of data exists for the structural indicators on municipal waste: structural indicators (see at the bottom of the page, concept \"21.2 Related Metadata\", file \"tsien120_esms\").\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/env_wasgt_esms.htm",

The purpose of the survey is to:\r\nExamine where there may be constraints on the availability of finance, and how those may be changing.\r\nProvide evidence on the need for finance (loans, equity and other) in the future, for example to promote growth.\r\nIdentify the sources from which businesses would wish to obtain this finance.\r\n It is important to be able to compare businesses that have shown sharp growth in recent years with those that have not; and to separate more recently formed businesses from others. As a consequence, the survey will collect information separately for \"gazelles\" (defined at page 3 below); other high-growth businesses that have been established longer than gazelles; and other businesses. Only businesses with an employment of 10-249 in 2005 and at least 10 employees in 2010 are being covered.\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/acf_esms.htm",
