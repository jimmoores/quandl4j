Today, 46 signatory countries are engaged in the process towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental initiative which also involves the European Commission, the Council of Europe and UNESCO-CEPES, as well as representatives of higher education institutions, students, staff, employers and quality assurance agencies. It aims to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010, and to promote the European system of higher education worldwide. More information on the Bologna process is available on http://ec.europa.eu/education/higher-education/doc1290_en.htm.\r\nMany indicators on social dimension and mobility in the Bologna process come from the UOE data collection in the education statistics domain. The aim of the education statistics domain is to provide comparable statistics and indicators on key aspects of the education systems across Europe. The data cover participation and completion of education programmes, personnel in education and the cost and type of resources dedicated to education.\r\nThe main source of data is the joint UIS (UNESCO Institute of Statistics)/OECD/Eurostat (UOE) questionnaires on education statistics, which constitute the core database on education. Data on regional enrolments and foreign language learning are collected additionally by Eurostat. Countries provide data, coming from administrative records, on the basis of commonly agreed definitions.\r\nFrom the UOE data collection, the following datasets on the Bologna Process are available:\r\nA. Widening access\r\neduc_bo_ac_ent2: Net entry rate (ISCED 5A) by age and sex\r\neduc_bo_ac_ent3: Female entrants by field of education (ISCED 5A)\r\neduc_bo_ac_gent: Entrants at ISCED 5A and qualifying graduates of secondary schooling (ISCED 3A - 4A)\r\neduc_bo_ac_el1t: Students (ISCED 5A) studying part-time, by age \r\nB. Study framework\r\neduc_bo_fi_fgdp: Public expenditure on tertiary education (ISCED 5-6), as % of GDP or total public expenditure\r\neduc_bo_fi_ftot: Annual total expenditure on educational institutions (ISCED 5-6) per full-time equivalent student with and without expenditure on research and ancillary services\r\neduc_bo_fi_ffun: Tertiary education institutions' income from private sources (households and other private entities) as % of all public and private sources\r\neduc_bo_fi_fiaid: Public financial aid to tertiary students (ISCED 5-6), by type of aid, as % of public expenditure on tertiary education\r\nC. Student and staff mobility\r\neduc_bo_mo_el8o: Students (ISCED 5A and 6) who are nationals of a given country, studying in another country (EU-27, EFTA and CC) as % of the total enrolment in that country\r\neduc_bo_mo_el8i: Number of foreign students (world and Bologna Area) studying in a given country, as % of the total enrolment in that country, ISCED 5A and 6\r\neduc_bo_mo_gr4: Graduates (ISCED 5A and 6) from abroad (non-citizens, permanent residence and prior education outside the country)\r\nD. Effective outcomes and employability\r\neduc_bo_ou_gren: Gross graduation rate and net entry rate, ISCED 5A\r\n \r\nThe data for some countries which do not participate in the UOE data collection were provided to Eurostat specifically for the monitoring of the Bologna Process. Not being fully integrated in the UOE, the data sometimes might not be as comparable as the data for the remaining countries, due to differences in the underlying data sources and definitions. These data were provided by the following entities:\r\nAndorra (AD): data provided by the University of Andorra (indicators educ_bo_ac_ent3, educ_bo_fi_ffun, educ_bo_mo_el8i, educ_bo_mo_gr4)\r\nArmenia (AM): data provided by the Ministry of Education and Science (educ_bo_ac_gent, educ_bo_ac_el1t, educ_bo_mo_gr4, educ_bo_ou_gren)\r\nGeorgia (GE): data provided by the NSI, Statistics Georgia (educ_bo_ac_ent3, educ_bo_ac_el1t, educ_bo_fi_fgdp, educ_bo_mo_gr4)\r\nSerbia (RS): data provided by the NSI, Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (educ_bo_mo_el8i)\r\nUkraine (UA): data provided by the NSI, State Statistics Committee for Ukraine (educ_bo_ou_gren, educ_bo_ac_el1t, educ_bo_mo_el8i, educ_bo_mo_gr4, educ_bo_ou_gren)\r\n\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/educ_bo_ac_ent2_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-08-21T20:30:52.628Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2006-12-31","to_date":"2006-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":9130779,"source_name":"Bureau of Labor Statistics Key Indicators","source_code":"BLS","code":"OEUN000000054100027409901","name":"Employment for Media and Communication Equipment Workers, All Other in Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services in National","urlize_name":"Employment-for-Media-and-Communication-Equipment-Workers-All-Other-in-Professional-Scientific-and-Technical-Services-in-National","display_url":"http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v1/timeseries/data/OEUN000000054100027409901","description":"Statistic: Employment; Occupation: Media and Communication Equipment Workers, All Other; Industry: Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services; Area: National; Source: BLS Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program.
