The information on waste generation has a breakdown in sources (several business activities according to the NACE classification and household activities) and in waste categories (according to the European Waste Classification for statistical purposes). The information on waste treatment is broken down to five treatment types (recovery, incineration with energy recovery, other incineration, disposal on land and land treatment) and in waste categories; this data set also has a breakdown in regions (NUTS1). All values are measured in tonnes of waste.\r\nThe Member States are free to decide on the data collection methods. The general options are: surveys, administrative sources, statistical estimations or some combination of methods.\r\nFor the first reference year 2004 Member States could apply for permission not to deliver part of the information: waste generated by agriculture and fishing and waste generated in the services sector. For this reason this information is missing for some of the countries.\r\nPreviously data on waste was collected on a voluntary basis with the joint OECD/Eurostat questionnaire on waste. A separate annual collection of data exists for the structural indicators on municipal waste: structural indicators (see at the bottom of the page, concept \"21.2 Related Metadata\", file \"tsien120_esms\").\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/env_wasgt_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-01-10T05:24:46Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2008-12-31","to_date":"2008-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=2&downfile=data%2Ften00107.sdmx.zip"},{"id":10850972,"source_code":"SEC","source_name":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","code":"FUR_NETINCOMELOSSALLOCATEDTORESTRICTEDSHARES_Q","name":"Winthrop Realty Trust  (FUR): Quarterly Net Income Loss Allocated To Restricted Shares","urlize_name":"Winthrop-Realty-Trust-FUR-Quarterly-Net-Income-Loss-Allocated-To-Restricted-Shares","description":"SEC Name: NetIncomeLossAllocatedToRestrictedShares","updated_at":"2014-03-07T16:02:34Z","frequency":"daily","from_date":"2013-03-31","to_date":"2013-09-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"display_url":null},{"id":5928733,"source_code":"UN","source_name":"United Nations","code":"COMM_96_SLIDEFASTENERSNES_EXPORT_SWE","name":"Commodity Exports - Miscellaneous Manufactured Articles / Slide fasteners, nes - Sweden","urlize_name":"Commodity-Exports-Miscellaneous-Manufactured-Articles-Slide-fasteners-nes-Sweden","description":"The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) stores more than 1 billion trade data records from 1962.
