Main indicators on \"educational attainment\" and \"transition from education to work, early leavers from education and training\"\r\nThe LFS education-related indicators on early leavers from education and training, education attainment level and young people neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET) are a collection of annual series based on the quarterly results of the EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). They are published in the section 'main indicators'. The data source, EU-LFS is, where necessary, adjusted and enriched in various ways, in accordance with the specificities of an indicator, including the following:\r\n- correction of the main breaks in the LFS series,\r\n- estimation of the missing values, (i.e. in case of missing quarters, annual results and EU aggregates are estimated using adjusted quarterly national labour force survey data or interpolations of the EU Labour Force Survey data with reference to the available quarter(s))\r\nEarly leavers from education and training and tertiary educational attainment are also Europe 2020 Indicators. Early school leavers are part of the Sustainable Development Indicators.\r\n2. Detailed tables\r\nBeside these main results, LFS detailed tables are also available. The results might differ from the 'main indicators' series are the data are not adjusted as explained above.\r\n3. Ad-hoc modules\r\nIn addition to these series, an ad-hoc module to the LFS was conducted in 2000 on the entry of young people into the labour market. Similar data have been collected in a 2009 ad-hoc module to the LFS (publication foreseen in the 4th quarter of 2011). \nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/edat_esms.htm","updated_at":"2013-02-18T03:42:33.630Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2007-12-31","to_date":"2007-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":10573876,"source_name":"Securities and Exchange Commission Filings","source_code":"SEC","code":"HSII_DEFERREDINCOMETAXEXPENSESBENEFIT_A","name":"HEIDRICK &amp; STRUGGLES INTERNATIONAL INC  (HSII): Annual Deferred Income Tax Expenses Benefit","urlize_name":"HEIDRICK-amp-STRUGGLES-INTERNATIONAL-INC-HSII-Annual-Deferred-Income-Tax-Expenses-Benefit","display_url":null,"description":"SEC Name: DeferredIncomeTaxExpensesBenefit","updated_at":"2014-03-07T03:16:01.489Z","frequency":"daily","from_date":"2012-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":5920426,"source_name":"United Nations","source_code":"UN","code":"COMM_96_PENNIBSNIBPOINTSNES_IMPORT_JOR","name":"Commodity Imports - Miscellaneous Manufactured Articles / Pen nibs, nib points nes - Jordan","urlize_name":"Commodity-Imports-Miscellaneous-Manufactured-Articles-Pen-nibs-nib-points-nes-Jordan","display_url":"http://data.un.org/browse.aspx","description":"The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) stores more than 1 billion trade data records from 1962.
